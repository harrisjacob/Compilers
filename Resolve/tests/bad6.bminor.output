My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

If my records are correct, sometime in the chaos of today you forgot to declare b.
Maybe it's mispelled. Maybe you commented out the declaration. Maybe you just didn't
declare it because you assumed somebody else would come along and declare it for you.
Well I'm sorry to break the news to you, but nobody is going to declare b for you.
You'll have to do that yourself. Please give b a proper declaration so we can get
this whole execution thing underway.

Sincerely,
	 The Name Resolver
