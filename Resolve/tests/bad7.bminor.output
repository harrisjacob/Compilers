My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

If you are seeing this message you have found an easter egg in
the compiler that only occurs when you redeclare a variable such as
you did with a. While other compilers might be so bold to assume you
made some form of mistake, I think you meant to redeclare a. Why you
chose to redeclare a, I do not know. It is not my job to know these
kind of things. While this was a fun one sided conversation, I think you
should take another look at your declarations of a.

Sincerely,
	The Name Resolver

a resolves to param 0 of scope 1
b resolves to param 1 of scope 1
d resolves to local 0 of scope 1
