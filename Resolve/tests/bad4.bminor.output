My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

You may not have realized it, but you actually already declared a as
type integer.  It's nothing to be embarrassed about, we all do it from time
to time, but you can't make a type char after saying it was a integer. You'll
have to pick one type or maybe change one of the names. Until then, I just
don't know which type of a you want to use.

Sincerely,
	The Name Resolver
