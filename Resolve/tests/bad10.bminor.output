My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

You may not have realized it, but you actually already declared a as
type integer.  It's nothing to be embarrassed about, we all do it from time
to time, but you can't make a type string after saying it was a integer. You'll
have to pick one type or maybe change one of the names. Until then, I just
don't know which type of a you want to use.

Sincerely,

My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

You may not have realized it, but you actually already declared a as
type integer.  It's nothing to be embarrassed about, we all do it from time
to time, but you can't make a type boolean after saying it was a integer. You'll
have to pick one type or maybe change one of the names. Until then, I just
don't know which type of a you want to use.

If my records are correct, sometime in the chaos of today you forgot to declare myName.
Maybe it's mispelled. Maybe you commented out the declaration. Maybe you just didn't
declare it because you assumed somebody else would come along and declare it for you.
Well I'm sorry to break the news to you, but nobody is going to declare myName for you.
You'll have to do that yourself. Please give myName a proper declaration so we can get
this whole execution thing underway.

My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

If you are seeing this message you have found an easter egg in
the compiler that only occurs when you redeclare a variable such as
you did with a. While other compilers might be so bold to assume you
made some form of mistake, I think you meant to redeclare a. Why you
chose to redeclare a, I do not know. It is not my job to know these
kind of things. While this was a fun one sided conversation, I think you
should take another look at your declarations of a.
