My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

If you are seeing this message you have found an easter egg in
the compiler that only occurs when you redeclare a variable such as
you did with foo. While other compilers might be so bold to assume you
made some form of mistake, I think you meant to redeclare foo. Why you
chose to redeclare foo, I do not know. It is not my job to know these
kind of things. While this was a fun one sided conversation, I think you
should take another look at your declarations of foo.

Sincerely,
	The Name Resolver
