My dear, sweet, innocent friend,

If you are seeing this message you have found an easter egg in
the compiler that only occurs when you redeclare a variable such as
you did with y. While other compilers might be so bold to assume you
made some form of mistake, I think you meant to redeclare y. Why you
chose to redeclare y, I do not know. It is not my job to know these
kind of things. While this was a fun one sided conversation, I think you
should take another look at your declarations of y.

Sincerely,
	The Name Resolver

z resolves to local 2 of scope 1
